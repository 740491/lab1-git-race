Adding new images is easy and does not require modifying more than one file:
1) Create, if it does not exist already on the path "src/main/resources/static"the following subdirectory "images".
2) There create an <img> on the jsp file with the path to "src/main/resources/static/images/NAME_of_the_image.Ext"
