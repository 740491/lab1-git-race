Added a hyperlink to a youtube video
I followed some reseach along the way to make sure I was indeed doing the task proposed : 
- First of all,  I studied the github's code so I could understand what the code was programed to do
- Second of all I searched information about  hyperlinks on http and adding such information to jsp files, checking stackoverflow and some other forums in the process
- Finally, I helping myself from a stackoverflow post, I used "<a" with "href" to get the hyperlink working
